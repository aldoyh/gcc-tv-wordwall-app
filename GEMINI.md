## MAIN FEATURES

### 1. Create using templates

#### Our activities are created using a template system

Interactives and printables

Wordwall can be used to create both interactive and printable activities. Most of our templates are available in both an interactive and a printable version.

Interactives are played on any web-enabled device, like a computer, tablet, phone or interactive whiteboard. They can be played individually by students, or be teacher-led with students taking turns at the front of the class.

Printables can be printed out directly or downloaded as a PDF file. They can be used as a companion to the interactive or as stand-alone activities.

## Create using templates

Our activities are created using a template system.

These templates include familiar classics like Quiz and Crossword. We also have arcade style games like Maze Chase and Airplane, and there are classroom management tools such as Seating plan.

To make a new activity you start by selecting your template and then enter your content. It's easy and means you can create a fully interactive activity in a only a couple of minutes.

Switching template
Once you've created an activity, you can switch it to a different template with a single click. This saves you time and is great for differentiation and reinforcement.

For example, if you created a Match activity based on names of shapes, you could turn it into a Crossword with the exact the same shape names.

In the same way we can turn your resource into a Quiz or a Wordsearch and many more possibilities too.

Edit any activity
There's no need to settle for pre-made activities. If you find an activity but it's not quite right, you can easily customize the material to suit your class and your teaching style.

Visual styles and options
Interactives can be presented in different visual styles. Each visual style changes the look and feel with different graphics, fonts, and sounds.

You'll also find further options to set a timer or change the gameplay.

The printables have options too. For example, you can change the font, or print multiple copies per page.

Student assignments
Wordwall activities can be used as student-completed assignments. When a teacher sets an assignment, students are directed to that one activity without the distraction of visiting the main activity page.

This feature can be used in-class where students have access to their own devices, or as a way of setting homework.

Each student's results are recorded and made available to the teacher.

Sharing with teachers
Any activity you create can be made public. This allows you to share its activity page link via email, on social media or via other means. It also allows other teachers to find the activity in our Community search results, play it, and build upon it.

If you prefer you can keep activities private, which means only you can access it.

Embedding on a website
Wordwall activities can be placed on another website using a snippet of HTML code. It works in the same way as the video embed feature you find on YouTube or Vimeo, giving you a playable activity on your own site.

This is a great way to enhance your own blog or your school's virtual learning environment (VLE).
